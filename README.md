Starting point for creating projects with HTML canvas, typescript and vite.

- Sets up a basic loop with the update and render pattern.

- Centers the canvas

- Gives the page a black background

- Allows me to have a starting point for when I want to create something and I don't want to remember what the type is for canvas so my LSP can have autocomplete.
